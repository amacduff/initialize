# Initialize
A fun little group project focused on styling dropcaps (or initials) with CSS

## How to Play
Once you've been nominated and added to the contributors list, simply choose the next letter in the alphabet and style it however you like

## Rules
- Only selectable text (no images for the dropcap)
- Capitals Only
- Feel free to upload any assets you want to use, but try to keep file sizes down
